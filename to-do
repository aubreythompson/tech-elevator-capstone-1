missing functionality:

- unit tests        //I imagine this'll be most of Friday's work. We can just divide up the different classes so we don't get clashes or do whatever.
-- logging  //Should be good to go. Again just something to keep an eye on
-- make change      //I've tested the heck out of this, but every once in a while I was able to break it again, make another
                    //change and seemingly fix it. Just keep an eye on it when testing other stuff. Occasionally see if the change
                    //amount seems legit
-- feed money       //basically same as make change, but this one has been more consistantly solid for me
-- dispense product     //What's going on with this one?
                        -- is something weird happening, or are you just wondering why it's here?
                        --I'm just listing the things we have to test, whether they're working or not

- handling erroneous user input? or do we think the menu class handles it well enough?  //I think the menu is pretty good.
                                                                                        //However, hardware does fail. RAM
                                                                                        //is pretty reliable. Mass storage devices not so much.
                                                                                        //You know they'll be picky, we gatta do it :/. Friday's looking like
                                                                                        //keep trying to break our stuff and further fix it day.
                                                                                        -- I'm not actually sure how to handle it better - I guess I'll try breaking it and see what happens.
                                                                                        -- no matter what they put in, it comes back with "___ is not a valid option"
                                                                                        -- as long as we use the menu class, which I guess we are considering not ...


bugs:

fine but ideally should be cleaner:

    //I do agree. Let's get all the functionality in the program first, make sure we break proof it as much as we can, and then
    //I'm totally down to figure out how to go about displaying things in a less depressing way haha
- it would be fun/cute to display the vending machine more aesthetically


Questions

    //There probably is some other way that may be more optimal, but I'm not sure what it'd be as of right now.
- is our code maximally loosely coupled? I changed it so that only VendingMachine interacts with IO like we have in
our diagram. I think everything else needs to talk to each other?
