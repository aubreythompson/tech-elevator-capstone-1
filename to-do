missing functionality:

- unit tests
-- logging
--- did not get to testing all cases in FileIO. the coverage report does a pretty good job of showing what I missed actually.
--- went with the testing if Strings are as expected/whether the file was successfully written method.

- handling erroneous user input? or do we think the menu class handles it well enough?  //I think the menu is pretty good.
                                                                                        //However, hardware does fail. RAM
                                                                                        //is pretty reliable. Mass storage devices not so much.
                                                                                        //You know they'll be picky, we gatta do it :/. Friday's looking like
                                                                                        //keep trying to break our stuff and further fix it day.
                                                                                        -- I'm not actually sure how to handle it better - I guess I'll try breaking it and see what happens.
                                                                                        -- no matter what they put in, it comes back with "___ is not a valid option"
                                                                                        -- as long as we use the menu class, which I guess we are considering not ...


bugs:

fine but ideally should be cleaner:

    //I do agree. Let's get all the functionality in the program first, make sure we break proof it as much as we can, and then
    //I'm totally down to figure out how to go about displaying things in a less depressing way haha
- it would be fun/cute to display the vending machine more aesthetically


Questions

    //There probably is some other way that may be more optimal, but I'm not sure what it'd be as of right now.
- is our code maximally loosely coupled? I changed it so that only VendingMachine interacts with IO like we have in
our diagram. I think everything else needs to talk to each other?
